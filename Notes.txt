Trying to get the bulkInitialLoad going.

I created a new fn on the backend, called bulkInitialLoadForPureJs so I can get the Banner image url
I changed the Banner to be the shared id for the file
The error for it says that A JSONObject text must begin with '{' at 1 [character 2 line 1]

I'm thinking that the data needs to corrected to be put into the json object.
It may also be worth returning a json object instead of text too.

Right now I'm trying to figure out how best to create a shared_link so I can get the image urls.
I'm thinking that automaticaly creating them is best, so the staff don't have to manually do this.
One option is to use the box.com api, but it seems to need extra dependencies:

The other is to write a put command with pure Java and HttpUrlConnection:
